# Belly_Button Project

## Project Overview
A young scientist created an experiment to determine the types of bacteria that exist within a person's belly button.  The project includes a JSON file with several hundred volunteers' data and bacteria results.  The challenge uses this JSON file to display the results of the experiment with a JavaScript written web site.  There is an interactive drop down menu that changes the displayed results using plotly libraries. The site allows the volunteers to review their results and utlitmately decide if they can donate their bacteria to assist with a meat producing company.  

## Project Summary
The drop down menu allows users to interact with the plotly bar, bubble and gauge charts.  Once an id is selected, the charts update to show the results of the bacteria testing for that particular id.  The charts are colorful, informative and clearly marked with values for bacteria readings. There are a variety of different bacteria which vary a great deal among all test subjects.  Users who were volunteers will find the site very helpful in making a decision on whether as to whether they are able to help this meat company.
